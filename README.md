# The Paperchase - Entry for ScreamJam 2024
Blurred vision, the screen fades, seeing a lit fire, a warmth in an otherwise dark exterior of a forest.  
The air is cold, the silhouette of nature the only thing visible in an otherwise dark environment.  
The silence broken with crackling and static from a radio at your side, a friend?  
Perhaps.  

Journey as Jake, a young man facing the unknown in this forest, tasked with seemingly simple trials and perhaps a simple conclusion.  

Only you and the forest know the answer to that.
